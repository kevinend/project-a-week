MAIN: 
xx--Use Temporary allocator, free memory on every iteration of the loop
xx--Allow free-form expressions, so just e1 ^ e1 should return the result to the console
--Allow input to come from a file instead of stdin

LEXER:
xx--Convert number to K-Element with basis = 0
xx--How do we handle empty input in the buffer or zero tokens?
xx--Pass the one element symbols from the environment instead of caching them in the lexer
xx--Not handling the case of line numbers and characters in the input
--Error messages, add a 'error_detected' flag on the lexer and have that fill out a log
  You set the flag, log the message then report in main if you found an error
  Need all the 'compose' functions to return an error token, so when we report an error we return an error token
  that way we can return cleanly to the parent scope that will return back up from there

PARSER:
--Maybe need but it would be nice just to print the value, i guess we don't want to sub if it is just a raw token?
--Handle keywords, kind of skipping over them for now
--Revisit the use of t0,t1,t2; are they too simplistic? is the code hard to follow?
--Error messages
  Undeclared idenfitier, this error needs to propogate up or we need to return NULL
  Or something like hte lexer where you flag
 
EVAL:
--Interior product, use regressive with comp of second arg
--Left and Right additive identity (0 + e1) does not resolve correctly

ENVIRONMENT:
--Should we clear all symbols on an environment change? Yes we have to
--Don't handle changing dimensions gracefully
   If the dimension is less than the current but the symbols didn't change we don't have to do anything
   If the symbols changed then we have to regenerate the symbols
   If the dimension expands then we need to go through this whole process again because we introduced new one elements
   and everyone's index is hosed!!!
