MAIN: 
xx--Use Temporary allocator, free memory on every iteration of the loop
xx--Allow free-form expressions, so just e1 ^ e1 should return the result to the console
--Allow input to come from a file instead of stdin
  (if you allow a file then you want to run the loop for each of the lines in the file)

TESTS:
-- we are changing things and can't check whether we broke the tests or not!

LEXER:
xx--Convert number to K-Element with basis = 0
xx--How do we handle empty input in the buffer or zero tokens?
xx--Pass the one element symbols from the environment instead of caching them in the lexer
xx--Not handling the case of line numbers and characters in the input
--Error messages, add a 'error_detected' flag on the lexer and have that fill out a log

PARSER:
--Handle keywords, kind of skipping over them for now
xx--Revisit the use of t0,t1,t2; are they too simplistic? is the code hard to follow? (nope, pretty clean to me)
--ERROR HANDLING NEEDS REVISITED and thought out a lot better than it is now, it is janky and not helpful with simple mistakes.
  I think i may need to add information to the lexer about the CLASS/CATEGORY something is
  if !error && !next_factor {
  	add the code to say that you didn't find a 	
  }

  too tired, got the 3 +; and 3 ^; errors to report correctly if you have 3 <<; we aren't reporting an error like 'missing expression'
  after unary operator since after we get three back we check for wedge, antiwedge, then plus or minus, maybe at the top-level if it doesn't
  equal a semicolon we just report an error and check if it is a unary operator
 
EVAL:
--Interior product, use regressive with comp of second arg
--Left and Right additive identity (0 + e1) does not resolve correctly

ENVIRONMENT:
--Should we clear all symbols on an environment change? Yes we have to
--Don't handle changing dimensions gracefully
   If the dimension is less than the current but the symbols didn't change we don't have to do anything
   If the symbols changed then we have to regenerate the symbols
   If the dimension expands then we need to go through this whole process again because we introduced new one elements
   and everyone's index is hosed!!!
