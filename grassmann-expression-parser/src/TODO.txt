MAIN: 
xx--Use Temporary allocator, free memory on every iteration of the loop
--Allow input to come from a file instead of stdin
--Allow free-form expressions, so just e1 ^ e1 should return the result to the console

LEXER:
xxConvert number to K-Element with basis = 0
--How do we handle empty input in the buffer or zero tokens?
--Remove the one element symbols and pass in the environment directly for symbol resolution
--Error messages

PARSER:
--Maybe need but it would be nice just to print the value, i guess we don't want to sub if it is just a raw token?
--Handle keywords, kind of skipping over them for now
--Revisit the use of t0,t1,t2; are they too simplistic? is the code hard to follow?
--Error messages

L1 = e1;
L1; --> should print the value
or some expression should print the value
other than that it just needs assigned

EVAL:
--Interior product, use regressive with comp of second arg
--Left and Right additive identity (0 + e1) does not resolve correctly

ENVIRONMENT:
--Should we clear all symbols on an environment change? Yes we have to
--Don't handle changing dimensions gracefully
   If the dimension is less than the current but the symbols didn't change we don't have to do anything
   If the symbols changed then we have to regenerate the symbols
   If the dimension expands then we need to go through this whole process again because we introduced new one elements
   and everyone's index is hosed!!!
