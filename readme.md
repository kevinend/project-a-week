Note, the projects in this repo are experiments with different data structures, algorithms and problems.
This code is most often nowhere near production quality. However, solving (or attempting to solve) problems is the best way to learn 
and gain experience which is what I strive to do with this repository.

I've committed one week to each endeavor with the intention to circle back at different points to either revise, augment or rewrite
the solutions I derived at an earlier time. The time towards each project is not consistent (not exactly an hour a day or something like this)
but just the amount of time I can afford during the week.

My hope is that working on smaller projects with a very limited scope allows me to learn more in a shorter amount of time rather than setting
some large project with a month or year timeline. Only time will tell if this is truly effective.
